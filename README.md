# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the Project:

The purpose of this Project is to perform analysis of the City and Pyber ride data in order to understand metrics of total rides in each of the cities, get the number of drivers in each city type, obtain the total amount of fares for each city type, understand the average fare per ride in each city type, the average fare per driver and develop a summary data frame. Using Pandas and Matplotlib and presenting a multiple-line graph, management are able to make more accurate data


# Result of the Analysis:

We are able to conclude the following Summary of the Data:

Reviewing this data we can summarize the following:

- Urban has the highest Total Fares with the highest number of drivers. However Rural has the lowest number of fares and least number of rides but they are making much higher average rate than Suburban and Urban



## Summary of the Analysis:

My recommendation of the findings is to reduce the number of drivers in Urban to increase the average Fare per Driver in Urban and to ensure the all drivers are making good living to provide the best services for their city type. We can go further in our analysis to find how much an average driver makes in each of the city types and the population to understand how stressful/security/life Style is and to provide the best recommendation on what should be the average driver making per month. This will enhance our analysis to determine weather we should increase or decrease the number of drivers in each city type. Also look for other ways to increase the number of rides per city type
